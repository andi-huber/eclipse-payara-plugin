# Eclipse Payara tools - releng

Releng (RElease ENGineering) contains an extensive amount of build code to build Payara Tools from the command line
(outside Eclipse IDE).

The build helper code is first build itself from `/corundum-source` and then installed into `/corundum`, from where the rest
of the Payara Tools build is then driven from.
